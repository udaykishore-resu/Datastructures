#1) General Tree
The general tree is the basic representation of a tree. It has a node and one or more child nodes. The top-level node i.e. the root node is present at level 1 and all the other nodes may be present at various levels.

A General Tree is shown in the below figure.

General Tree
-------------
As shown in the above figure, a general tree may contain any number of subtrees. The nodes B, C, and D are present at level 2 and are sibling nodes. Similarly, nodes E, F, G, and H are also sibling nodes.

The nodes present at different levels may exhibit a parent-child relationship. In the above figure, nodes B, C and D are children of A. Nodes E and F are children of B whereas nodes G and H are children of D.
